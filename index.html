        <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
        <p>This site serves as a CV as well as a miniature portfolio for various things. I am a pretty private individual and I enjoy the Internets freedom, so many things I do online are not associated with my real name.</p>

        <p>I'm not the most photogenic <i>(or even have many photos of me that'd suit..)</i> </p>
        <p>So have this image of ryan gosling in glasses, he may be better groomed, looking and everything else, but he is literally me after all.</p>

      <h1 class="highlight">About Me</h1>
      <p>I have been the 'tech guy' for as long as I can remember. A story as old as tech itself i'm sure.</p>
      <p>Whenever somebody I know has a computer related issue, i'm usually the go-to guy for the job.</p>
      <h2>Getting into tech</h2>
      <h2>Linux Hobby</h2>
      <h2>Journey into Cybersecurity</h2>
             <p>I was quite lucky really, there was the right opportunity at the right time, and I entered the Cyber sector in an apprenticeship role.</p>
       <p>This role gave me the opportunity to catch up quick in areas I was not proficient in and gave me experience in a range of Cybersecurity arenas.</p>

       <h1 class="highlight">Experience</h1>
       <h2>Management</h2>
       <p>Before entering Cyber as a career, I was working in a local retail environment and managed, partly due to workplace situations at the time and i'd like to think performance, I was a store manager in a concession store, including manager permissions on the tills for the main store we were residing in.</p>
       <p>This time in a managerial role meant I got to experience dealing with coworkers and customers in an authoritative role. The experience of doing so I think improved my communication as well as teamworking skills.</p>
       <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
       <p>I have been working in Cybersecurity for a few years now, starting with an apprenticeship that gave me a broad understanding of the field.</p>
       <p>I've worn many hats and found things I like to do, and some less so.</p>
       <p>My current role may say 'Cyber Security Analyst', but i've done web development, incident management/response, vCISO work, tons of consultant work and more.</p>
